'''
75% of the roads have 0 contracts and 0 km of works. This means that the majority of the roads are in a good condition. They are the roads assigned category A. 

The rest 25% of the roads are split between categories 'B', 'C', and 'D' based on a deeper look amongst their distribution.

We observe that 50% of the roads being worked upon â€” ~12.5% of total roads â€” have max 3 work contracts active and at most 5 km of compromised road. These roads make up category B.

We then observe that 25% of the roads being worked on â€” ~6.25% of total roads â€” have max 4 work contracts and at most 22 km of compromised road. These roads make up category C.

The remaining roads are assigned category D.
